+4dBu balanced input and output modification for Revox B77 tape recorders

Project ID on printed circuit boards is **20-12.01.00**

### Description:
PCB mounted on some B77 decks that underwent full restauration by strangelove audio. The PCB replaces the original RCA connectors with TRS jacks and provides balanced inputs and outputs at a +4dBu nominal signal level. The internal nominal level remains 0dB.

This project only modifies the B77 i/o connector housing. No other changes are made to the tape recorder.
